  <h1>Off-Campus Student Housing Analysis</h1>
  <p>Using data to help Boston students find safe, reliable housing</p>

    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Boston has over 96,000 undergraduate and 65,000 graduate students. More than half of undergrads live off-campus, 
      and most of those aren't living at home. Unlike students in dorms, off-campus renters don't get the same level 
      of security services or guaranteed living conditions. Many deal with difficult landlords or unsafe neighborhoods 
      without really knowing what they're getting into.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're building a tool that puts all the important information in one place. By looking at building violations, 
      student housing patterns, and neighborhood data, we want to help students figure out which areas and landlords 
      are actually reliable.

      <p>Can we identify which landlords and neighborhoods have the worst violation records?</p>

      That's a lot of students trying to navigate Boston's rental market on their own. This project is about giving 
      them better information to work with.

    <h2>How We're Doing It</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Where the data comes from:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building and property violations Dataset</li>
      <li>Student housing dataset from BUSpark</li>
      <li>Property assessment information dataset</li>
      <li>Historical records going back to 2013</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>The technical approach:</strong></p>
    <p>
      We're using K-means clustering to find groupings in the data. This will helps us spot patterns—like 
      neighborhoods where violations are common, or landlords who consistently have problems across multiple properties.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      As students, we know how hard it is to find good off-campus housing. The rental market can feel pretty hopeless and
      you don't really know what you're getting into until you've already signed a lease.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is about creating some transparency. If we can show which landlords have consistent problems, 
      or which neighborhoods have the most violations, students can make better decisions. Hopefully this will
      push landlords to take better care of their properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the road, we'd also like to talk to students directly about their experiences and understand why people 
      choose off-campus housing despite the challenges, and what could make it better.
